# StuckWin
Development of the interactive interface of a game with simple rules and creation of two automatic game algorithms for algorithmic comparison purposes.

## Detailed Explanation
This work was made over a 52 days learning and evaluation situation.

The final objective was to program the game "StuckWin" with instructions and constraints that had to be respected:
* The first part of the project had to be returned after 24 days. It was about the development of the interactive interface of the game "StuckWin". This meant we had to write given methods with precise instructions to display the state of the game, give the possible destinations for a given pawn, perform a given movement by simulating it to verify that it is playable and tell if the game is over or not.
* The second part of the project had to be returned at the end of the allotted time. It was about the design, implementation and comparison of two automatic game algorithms for the user to play against.
