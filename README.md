# StuckWin
Development of the interactive interface of a game with simple rules and creation of two automatic game algorithms for algorithmic comparison purposes.

## Detailed Explanation
This work was made over a 52 days learning and evaluation situation.

The final objective was to program the game "StuckWin" with instructions and constraints that had to be respected:
* The first part of the project had to be returned after 24 days. It was about the development of the interactive interface of the game "StuckWin".
* The second part of the project had to be returned at the end of the allotted time. It was about the design, implementation and comparison of two automatic game algorithms for the user to play against.
